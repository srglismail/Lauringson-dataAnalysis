This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



```{r}
library(readxl)
Df1dataset <- read_excel("Table1_The Role of Non-material Resources.XLSX")
```


Df2dataset <- Df1dataset[ ,c(1, 17)]
Df2dataset %>% pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = cranial_volume)



```{r}

ggplot(data = Df1dataset, aes(x = sex, y = cranial_volume, color= resource_rating))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~father_has_primary_education)

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = Df1dataset, aes(x = sex, y = cranial_volume)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean, fun.min = min, fun.max = max, geom = "point")+
  facet_wrap(~father_has_primary_education)
```
